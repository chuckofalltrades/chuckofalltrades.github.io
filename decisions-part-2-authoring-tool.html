I’ve decided to use GitHub Pages to host it. Now I need to decide on the tools to build and maintain it.</p><p class="p1">The simplest thing to do here would be some very simple HTML with a list of links. If all this is a pure portfolio, that could work.  My plan is for each project to be a GitHub repository, turn on Pages, and bam, you have a link that lets somebody explore that piece of training content. I could just take all those links, stick them on a simple page, and use one of the many templates out there to make it look nice. That would certainly work, but I don’t want this to be just a pure portfolio.</p><p class="p1">It’s also important to me to have a blogging aspect because I want to write about these projects and why I do the different things I do. I also want to write about innovations, ideas, tips, tricks, and that sort of thing. So, I need some sort of content management system (CMS).</p><p class="p1">When you are exploring GitHub Pages, one of the things that will pop up a lot is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is an extremely popular static site generator, and that’s what I thought I needed. But when I finally got around to this step and actually looked at Jekyll closely, I realized it was not what I was looking for. Jekyll is really designed with a developer in mind to write content in a very simple way using markdown files. Then Jekyll does the work of converting that into flat HTML files that you then put on your host. I could use that, but that again takes away from my objective of making this site seamless for me so I can focus on the projects.</p><p class="p1">I searched for alternatives to Jekyll and found a lot. I looked at <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://decapcms.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decap</a>, and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>. I realized I was going way too far down the wrong path. I was looking at either these static site generators intended to be command-line tools without much of a front end, or stepping back into traditional CMSs that require a backend server to function. These are not what I needed. I backed up and started searching specifically for a flat file generator CMS. After a little bit of digging around, I came across a few options and ultimately decided on one called <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii</a>.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/PubliiUI.png" alt="Screenshot of Publii UI writing this very article" width="1651" height="983" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/responsive/PubliiUI-xs.png 300w, https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/responsive/PubliiUI-sm.png 480w, https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/responsive/PubliiUI-md.png 768w, https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/responsive/PubliiUI-lg.png 1024w, https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/responsive/PubliiUI-xl.png 1360w, https://charlespalmer.me/media/posts/4/responsive/PubliiUI-2xl.png 1600w"><figcaption>Writing this very article, so meta!</figcaption></figure><p class="p1">Publii is an application available for both Windows and Mac. I didn’t really want to go with an application originally because I feel like that locks in my whole process to one computer. But to do what I want to do, I think it’s going to have to be that kind of solution. The more I poked around at Publii, the more I realized it’s pretty much exactly what I wanted. It’s a CMS, like WordPress or Drupal, but it doesn’t work like a traditional CMS running server side. It just publishes out your content into flat files, which then can be pushed to my Git repo. It’s cool because it even has integration to do that directly, it turns out to be a very seamless process</p><p class="p1">I’m really liking the tool so far. I’m writing this article in it right now. It’s got all the formatting tools I would expect for a visual editor, but it also has a lot of power under the hood that I can poke around at. What’s nice is because what it’s spitting out are pretty clean flat files, if I want to do something really complicated, there’s nothing stopping me from going into those flat files and editing them directly.</p><p class="p1">So, the solution is starting to come together. I’m hosting on GitHub Pages. I’m going to author and manage using Publii. So far, so good.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 17, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img src="https://charlespalmer.me/media/website/Charles-Profile-Pic-1.png" loading="lazy" height="1258" width="1258" class="bio__avatar" alt="Charles Palmer"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://charlespalmer.me/authors/charles-palmer/index.html" rel="author">Charles Palmer</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>L&amp;D thought leader passionate about innovation, creativity, and helping others become their best selves.</p></div></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://charlespalmer.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://charlespalmer.me/decisions-decisions.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Decisions, decisions...</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-05-03T12:25" class="feed__date">May 3, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://charlespalmer.me/decisions-decisions.html">Decisions, decisions...</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Charles Palmer | Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://charlespalmer.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://charlespalmer.me/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
