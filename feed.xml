                    Hello there! I am up and running with my new site here for my personal/professional portfolio and associated blog. Now that I’ve got it up and running, I figure I should go back and add a few initial articles to explain how I got here!&hellip;

                <p class="p1">Hello there!  I am up and running with my new site here for my personal/professional portfolio and associated blog. Now that I’ve got it up and running, I figure I should go back and add a few initial articles to explain how I got here!</p>
<p class="p1">The starting place is that I have recently been “impacted” at my job, meaning that I no longer have that job. This has got me thinking about my future and the potential need to look for jobs outside of my current company. Since I have no real presence outside my current company today, it’s time to create one.</p>
<p class="p1">This site will act as a place for me to store projects and serve as a portfolio should I seek jobs externally. Additionally, I want to start sharing my innovations and recording them in a more public format so that others in my industry can hopefully learn from me. I believe I have something valuable to share!  So whether you're here as a potential employer, or as a fellow L&amp;D professional, welcome!</p>
