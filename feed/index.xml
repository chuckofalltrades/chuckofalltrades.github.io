<p>In the <a href="/blog/building-this-site-part-1-overview/" class="ek-link">last post</a> I established a handful of things to consider in setting up a &#8220;blogfoliosume&#8221; (I should copyright that&#8230;) and promised a few more articles digging into the details. But before we go there it occurs to me that I should outline a few key parts of web design first, and hopefully dispel any trepidation you might feel on the more complex paths I&#8217;ll explore.</p>



<p>My primary audience here are my peers out there in the Learning &amp; Development field, especially Instructional Designers creating e-learnings. And in my experience many instructional designers don&#8217;t realize this very important fact: You are a web designer! When youâ€™re authoring e-learning content, you are doing web design. Whether you use Storyline, Rise, Captivate, Lectora, et al, you are creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files &#8211; a website! You&#8217;re just using a visual editing tool (or <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get - Tools for creating content where the creation looks the same as the output.">WYSIWYG</abbr>) designed for a specific purpose.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>E-learning design is web design!</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I hear you saying <em>&#8220;But Charles, I don&#8217;t write code!&#8221;</em> Maybe not directly, but neither do many web designers! In web design and development there are various roles: Some people consider themselves &#8220;<abbr title="The part your see, also called &quot;client side&quot; because your browser is the client.">front end</abbr>&#8221; or &#8220;<abbr title="The part you don't see, also called &quot;server side&quot; because it all happens on the remote server.">back end</abbr>&#8221; developers, creating the user interfaces on websites or programming the servers and databases that power them. There&#8217;s a whole class of &#8220;full stack&#8221; developers who do both. And there are those focused purely on visual design using tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud, et al. In most cases those designers than hand off their designs to the front end developers to implement &#8211; But in our case the tools do that for us!</p>



<p>Want more proof?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img data-dominant-color="c2c4c6" data-has-transparency="true" style="--dominant-color: #c2c4c6;" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1015" height="680" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_14-55-36-1.png" alt="Publishing window showing options for Title, Description, Folder location, Player type, Quality, and Publish. On the right side, there is a file directory with an arrow pointing to &quot;frame.desktop.min.js&quot; in the scripts folder." class="has-transparency wp-image-255" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_14-55-36-1.png 1015w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_14-55-36-1-300x201.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_14-55-36-1-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Example: Storyline publish to web produces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</figcaption></figure>



<p>See these files output by Storyline? It&#8217;s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (.js); this trio makes up the front end of all modern websites regardless of how they are built. The structure of the files is a bit atypical and the code is not super user friendly to read through, but that&#8217;s typical of most WYSIWYG tools. <em>Hypothetically</em> you could write all the code by hand and produce the exact same thing without even needing a design tool, goodbye Articulate 360 subscription! (Not that I&#8217;m actually suggesting that.)</p>



<p>I hear you asking questions again, <em>&#8220;But what about SCORM?  What about the LMS??  Won&#8217;t somebody please think of the LMS?!?&#8221;</em>.  Chill out, it&#8217;s all good!  Also you forgot to worry about xAPI.  Poor xAPI, always the afterthought.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img data-dominant-color="957443" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #957443;" decoding="async" width="480" height="360" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pleasethinkofthelms.gif" alt="Simpsons character Helen Lovejoy with a worried expression and hands clasped together, saying &quot;WON'T SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE LMS?!?&quot; while others look on in the background.  A parody of the classic scene in which she overreacts that someone should &quot;think of the children&quot;" class="not-transparent wp-image-256" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pleasethinkofthelms.gif 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pleasethinkofthelms-300x225.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></figure>



<p>For our purposes those things don&#8217;t matter. An LMS is just a specialized web server in the first place, with tools in place to handle things like learner registrations, enrollments, and reporting. SCORM is a standard, a common shared set of rules, for communication between an e-learning course and an LMS. Again, you could manually write the HTML/CSS/Javascript for a course and manually incorporate the SCORM standard (seriously, have a go at the <em>102 page</em> <a aria-label="documentation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://adlnet.gov/assets/uploads/SCORM_Users_Guide_for_Programmers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">documentation</a> next time you&#8217;re bored) and it would work fine on any standards-complaint LMS. But let&#8217;s not do that.</p>



<p>Since we just want to let potential clients and employers check out how awesome our work is, we don&#8217;t need all those special tools on an LMS, and therefore SCORM is irrelevant as well. And since we&#8217;ve established that all an e-learning design tool is creating is the same code files as any normal website, all we need is a normal website host and we can approach this whole thing as a web design project! See? We&#8217;ve come full circle!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fine. So, what is a website anyway?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img data-dominant-color="9e9aa1" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #9e9aa1;" decoding="async" width="406" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/classic_90s_internet_book.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Internet: A First Discovery Book&quot; by Scholastic featuring a child on a keyboard, appearing to surf on it over a globe, surrounded by other children and computer-related images." class="not-transparent wp-image-259" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/classic_90s_internet_book.jpg 406w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/classic_90s_internet_book-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The web used to be so cool.  Now it&#8217;s just memes and bad news and&#8230; other things.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The internet, or &#8220;Information Super Highway&#8221; for those of us who survived the 90s, is complicated. But at the same time, it&#8217;s actually not. The huge, powerful, interactive web apps we all use each day aside, a website is actually a pretty simple thing if you break it down. A basic website is a set of text files written in a standardized format (AKA code), literally each page of a site is a file. Those files live on a special computer that serves them to you (AKA the server) when you ask for them (by visiting the URL). Your browser knows how to read the code and show you the content (AKA render the page).  That&#8217;s it.  Seriously, try this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open you most basic text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on a Mac. Make sure it&#8217;s set to plain text.).</li>



<li>Just type some text. &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; is the classic.</li>



<li>Save it as <code>index.html</code> (doesn&#8217;t matter where so long as you can find it).</li>



<li>Double click the file.</li>
</ol>



<p>What happened?  Your browser opened and showed you what you wrote.  Congrats, you made a webpage!  And we didn&#8217;t even write any code (yet&#8230;).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">About that code</h3>



<p>Despite that ominous &#8220;yet&#8230;&#8221;, I&#8217;m not trying to trick you into a code tutorial, there are far better resources out there for that already (I&#8217;ll share some at the end of the article). But I do want to define some things here to help with the context of our blogfoliosume (I&#8217;m dropping the quotes, it&#8217;s a real word now) project. I&#8217;ve mentioned them a few times already: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let&#8217;s break them down in a way that&#8217;s useful to us in our e-learning context.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">HTML</h4>



<p>HTML defines the structure of a page, it&#8217;s the &#8220;bones&#8221; if you will.  It&#8217;s also where the actual content is, your words and pictures are in the HTML. You can think of HTML as code that defines the structure you expect in any word processor, saying things like &#8220;this is a paragraph&#8221;, &#8220;this is an image&#8221;, &#8220;this is a table&#8221;, etc. It says that using tags using angle brackets that look like this: <code>&lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p></code>. Here&#8217;s a simple example of some HTML and the page it creates:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:50%">
<div class="wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block"><pre class="CodeMirror" data-setting="{&quot;showPanel&quot;:true,&quot;languageLabel&quot;:&quot;language&quot;,&quot;fullScreenButton&quot;:true,&quot;copyButton&quot;:true,&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;htmlmixed&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/html&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:true,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;HTML&quot;,&quot;disableCopy&quot;:true,&quot;hasCustomCSS&quot;:false,&quot;customCSS&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;otterConditions&quot;:[],&quot;language&quot;:&quot;HTML&quot;,&quot;maxHeight&quot;:&quot;400px&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hi there, I'm a heading!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm a paragraph full of useful information!  But some information might be better in a list!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lists are great!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Each thing on the list is a &quot;list item&quot;, hence the li tags!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This list is unordered (ul) with bullets. It could also be ordered (ol) with numbers!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://charlesofalltrades.com&quot;&gt;And/ don't forget hyperlinks, the real superheroes of the internet!&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more paragraph for fun and then we'll close the body and page tags.  Bye!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:50%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-dominant-color="eeedee" data-has-transparency="true" style="--dominant-color: #eeedee;" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="687" height="412" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_16-33-04.png" alt="Screenshot of a webpage showing a heading, a paragraph, a bulleted list, a hyperlink, and another paragraph." class="has-transparency wp-image-262" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_16-33-04.png 687w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_16-33-04-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>As I said, not attempting to teach HTML here, but I hope that illustrates the idea that the HTML is just structure and content. You&#8217;ll also notice it&#8217;s pretty easy to read, but lacks any real design elements. Modern HTML practices try and avoid things like visual style, that&#8217;s the job of our next stop, CSS!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">CSS</h4>



<p>CSS stands for &#8220;Cascading Style Sheets&#8221; and can get pretty complicated, but it&#8217;s the language where a lot of that visual design we love comes from!  CSS defines the styles and formatting of the webpage content.  Fonts, colors, backgrounds, all defined in the page&#8217;s CSS.  Also layout things like how much space there is between elements or whether things should go on the right or the left are defined by CSS.</p>



<p>So when you selected your slide heading in Captivate and set it to be 36pt Helvetica in a nice dark blue, set your paragraphs to be 16pt not-quite-black, and decided the whole slide should have a nice cream background; Captivate wrote this for you:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block"><pre class="CodeMirror" data-setting="{&quot;showPanel&quot;:true,&quot;languageLabel&quot;:&quot;language&quot;,&quot;fullScreenButton&quot;:true,&quot;copyButton&quot;:true,&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;css&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/css&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:true,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;CSS&quot;,&quot;disableCopy&quot;:true,&quot;hasCustomCSS&quot;:false,&quot;customCSS&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;otterConditions&quot;:[],&quot;language&quot;:&quot;CSS&quot;,&quot;maxHeight&quot;:&quot;400px&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;css&quot;}">h1 {
  font-size: 36pt;
    font-family: 'Helvetica';
    color: #003366;
}

p {
  font-size: 16pt;
    font-family: 'Helvetica';
    color: #333333;
}

body {
    background-color: #f5f5dc;
}</pre></div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-dominant-color="e0e2ce" data-has-transparency="true" style="--dominant-color: #e0e2ce;" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="687" height="588" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_16-49-13.png" alt="Hi there, I'm a heading! And I'm a paragraph full of useful information! But some information might be better in a list! - Lists are great! - Each thing on the list is a &quot;list item&quot;, hence the li tags! - This list is unordered (ul) with bullets. It could also be ordered (ol) with numbers! And don't forget hyperlinks, the real superheroes of the internet! One more paragraph for fun and then we'll close the body and page tags. Bye!" class="has-transparency wp-image-263" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_16-49-13.png 687w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-17_16-49-13-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice the list and link were not affected because my example didn&#8217;t &#8220;target&#8221; them.  That&#8217;s where CSS can get complicated; there are considerations about specificity, parent/child hierarchies, IDs and classes, and much more that goes into styling an entire site.  But again, just want the concepts to stick here: CSS is for style and formatting.  </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JavaScript</h4>



<p>Now the big boy. JavaScript (it actually has no relation to Java, don&#8217;t get them confused!) is what powers dynamic interactivity on the modern web. Whenever a website does something other than just show you something, Javascript was involved. If you click and something changes without reloading the page? JavaScript. Something pops up? JavaScript. </p>



<p>JavaScript is its own profession, but it&#8217;s also really critical to us because all that interactivity we count on in e-learning is powered by it!  In fact I would argue that the difference between a beginner in e-learning design and an expert is awareness of how Javascript can be used in our tools! Both Storyline and Captivate have powerful Javascript tools under the hood, and opening them up is the key to taking your content to the next level!  Many future articles will be around doing just that.  But for now, the simple demonstration:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block"><pre class="CodeMirror" data-setting="{&quot;showPanel&quot;:true,&quot;languageLabel&quot;:&quot;language&quot;,&quot;fullScreenButton&quot;:true,&quot;copyButton&quot;:true,&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;htmlmixed&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/html&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:true,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;HTML&quot;,&quot;disableCopy&quot;:true,&quot;hasCustomCSS&quot;:false,&quot;customCSS&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;otterConditions&quot;:[],&quot;language&quot;:&quot;HTML&quot;,&quot;maxHeight&quot;:&quot;400px&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}">&lt;button onclick=&quot;toggleList()&quot;&gt;Toggle List&lt;/button&gt;
...
&lt;ul id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</pre></div>



<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block"><pre class="CodeMirror" data-setting="{&quot;showPanel&quot;:true,&quot;languageLabel&quot;:&quot;language&quot;,&quot;fullScreenButton&quot;:true,&quot;copyButton&quot;:true,&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;javascript&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/javascript&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:true,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;JavaScript&quot;,&quot;disableCopy&quot;:true,&quot;hasCustomCSS&quot;:false,&quot;customCSS&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;otterConditions&quot;:[],&quot;language&quot;:&quot;JavaScript&quot;,&quot;maxHeight&quot;:&quot;400px&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;js&quot;}">function toggleList() {
        var list = document.getElementById(&quot;example&quot;);
        if (list.style.display === &quot;none&quot;) {
          list.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;
        } else {
          list.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
        }
      }</pre></div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-dominant-color="e1e4cc" data-has-transparency="true" style="--dominant-color: #e1e4cc;" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="438" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-18_10-39-26-1.gif" alt="Animated gif showing the a small piece of content being toggled between visible and hidden using simple javascript." class="has-transparency wp-image-278" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-18_10-39-26-1.gif 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-18_10-39-26-1-300x202.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>Here I&#8217;ve added a button to our original HTML and given our list an ID to make it easier to target with the JavaScript.  When the user clicks that button it runs a function that basically just changes the other code, adding CSS styles that either hide or show that particular element.  It uses if/then type logic to decide what to change.  Again, that&#8217;s literally what your design tool is doing too!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group has-tertiary-background-color has-background has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained" style="border-width:5px;padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">
<p><i class="icon fas fa-circle-exclamation" aria-hidden="true"> </i> One last really important thing about all this code: Everything we&#8217;re talking about here is &#8220;front end&#8221; (AKA &#8220;client side&#8221; AKA &#8220;it&#8217;s all downloaded to your computer when you visit the page and doesn&#8217;t require the server to do anything special&#8221;).  This is critical as we start talking about solutions in the next articles.  If we needed &#8220;back end&#8221; functionality (AKA &#8220;server side&#8221; AKA &#8220;stuff that happens on the server before the page is even sent to you or after some trigger&#8221;) then we&#8217;d need different solutions than we&#8217;ll be talking about.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final thoughts</h2>



<p>This article went a bit different than I initially intended, but I hope it still had value.  If nothing else I hope it encourages you to start thinking like a web designer, because after all, you are!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key points:</h3>



<ul>
<li>E-learning design IS web design!</li>



<li>Your e-learning design tool is creating a web site, creating the same code you could write manually.</li>



<li>HTML provides the structure of a web page and is where the content lives.</li>



<li>CSS provides the styling, formatting, and layout of a web page.</li>



<li>JavaScript adds interactivity and is a powerful e-learning tool.</li>



<li>And because of all that, we can approach our portfolio project as a website building project!</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the next few posts I&#8217;ll walk through the decisions to make when building your own site of this type (the blogfoliosume).  Personally I lean towards the more technical and involved approach, but I will try and provide options along the way along with the pros and cons of each decision (i.e. the easy option vs the cheap option vs the flexible option, rarely can you get all 3).  Let&#8217;s begin!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purpose</h2>



<p>This site needs to serve three purposes for me, you may not need or want all three.  I need:</p>



<ul>
<li>A place to store training content (primarily e-learning) I&#8217;ve created and collect it as a portfolio</li>



<li>A resume that sells my skills and experience</li>



<li>A blog to share my best practices and provide context for the other things.  </li>
</ul>



<p>Each has slightly different requirements and considerations, let&#8217;s break them down.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Portfolio</h3>



<p>The need for a public portfolio is the highest priority and the original spark for this whole thing. I&#8217;ve created a lot of content over the years &#8211; e-learnings, videos, webapps, templates, etc &#8211; but they&#8217;re all stuck inside my employer. The first priority is a way to store projects of those types in a way that is easily accessible to anyone I wish to share them with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img data-dominant-color="6d5a4f" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="686" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2482016-1024x686.jpg" alt="Scrabble tiles spelling &quot;SHARE&quot; on a wooden tile rack, with scattered tiles in the background." class="not-transparent wp-image-235" style="--dominant-color: #6d5a4f; width:645px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2482016-1024x686.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2482016-300x201.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2482016-768x514.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2482016.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sharing is caring.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the surface this is simple, I just need a place to stick files. But what sort of files? Simple documents like PDFs or slide decks are easy thanks to services like Google Drive or Dropbox. Videos are also fairly straightforward using YouTube or Vimeo. But what about the complex e-learnings, the published content from Articulate Storyline or Adobe Captivate? At that point you need actual web hosting and that can get <em>very</em> complicated! Additional we have to consider storage space, how many projects do we want to share and how much space are they going to take up? Those files add up quick!</p>



<p>The other critical piece of the portfolio puzzle is presentation. At its simplest a document full of links will do the job, but it doesn&#8217;t carry quite the same cachet as a well designed visual experience! For that we&#8217;ll need a good presentation layer, some sort of <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> or site builder. This will also be a requirement for the Blog and Resume parts of this project. I&#8217;ll explore those options in Part 3.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-dominant-color="333d46" data-has-transparency="true" style="--dominant-color: #333d46;" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="975" height="990" data-id="236" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen-Shot-2024-06-17-at-11.35.57.png" alt="Example Portfolio webpage for featuring a welcoming message, a &quot;Hire Me&quot; button, and projects categorized into All, We App, Mobile App, Frontend, and Backend.

<figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">Both work, but which one would you hire?</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Resume</h3>



<p>At its simplest the resume (or <a aria-label="CV (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/career/difference-between-curriculum-vitae-and-resume" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">CV</a> if you prefer) is just another file, but I&#8217;ve got something bigger in mind. I want a dedicated page on the site that recreates my resume with more visual oomph than the &#8220;2 pages max&#8221; guidelines of the traditional resume file. I want a timeline and fancy bars to indicate skill levels, recommendations and references written like customer testimonials; this thing is like a product page for me!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img data-dominant-color="e3e6eb" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="657" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toha-hugo-theme-skills-example-screenshot-1024x657.png" alt="Example personal blog webpage featuring an &quot;About&quot; section detailing &quot;John Doe&quot; as a Software Engineer at &quot;Example Co.&quot; with skills in Kubernetes, Go Development, Cloud Computing, Docker, Prometheus, and Linux. Includes icons for leadership, teamwork, communication, hard work, fast learning, and problem-solving, as well as contact icons and a link to the resume." class="not-transparent wp-image-244" style="--dominant-color: #e3e6eb; object-fit:cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toha-hugo-theme-skills-example-screenshot-1024x657.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toha-hugo-theme-skills-example-screenshot-1536x985.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toha-hugo-theme-skills-example-screenshot-300x192.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toha-hugo-theme-skills-example-screenshot-768x493.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toha-hugo-theme-skills-example-screenshot.png 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I may have been heavily influenced by this Hugo theme.  <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/toha/" class="ek-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Source</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>So once again this will come back around to the need for a good web design approach.  Writing HTML from the ground up?  A good WYSIWYG design program?  Templates galore?  So many options to consider!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blog</h3>



<p>Throw a rock on the internet and you&#8217;ll hit a blogging platform, so this part is hypothetically easy. But ideally I want this whole thing seamless and integrated, I want the transition from a blog post into a portfolio example and over to the resume to all feel like it&#8217;s part of the same experience, which will be tough if they aren&#8217;t all built the same way. Luckily most good blogging platform also have tools for general page design.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img data-dominant-color="bcb092" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/B4B42032-1E5B-4A44-81BC-E5D288A22301-1024x585.webp" alt="Cartoon illustration of a bearded man wearing a colorful, mismatched outfit with floral, striped, and polka dot patterns, and different colored shoes." class="not-transparent wp-image-239" style="--dominant-color: #bcb092; width:675px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/B4B42032-1E5B-4A44-81BC-E5D288A22301-1024x585.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/B4B42032-1E5B-4A44-81BC-E5D288A22301-1536x878.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/B4B42032-1E5B-4A44-81BC-E5D288A22301-300x171.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/B4B42032-1E5B-4A44-81BC-E5D288A22301-768x439.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/B4B42032-1E5B-4A44-81BC-E5D288A22301.webp 1792w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Not the consistent style I&#8217;m going for.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the flipside, a lot of blogging platforms come with limits or undesirable elements like ads.  I don&#8217;t want to suddenly hit a wall where I can&#8217;t embed an example from my portfolio in the blog article explaining it because the platform doesn&#8217;t allow iframes!  So this platform has to be flexible and open.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other Considerations</h2>



<p>In addition to meeting the needs of the three purposes of my site, I have a handful of general &#8220;rules&#8221; for myself for this project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cost: Low to Zero</h3>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to spend any money on this thing, or at least the absolute least amount of money possible. This is partially just a challenge/choice thing, but it&#8217;s partially a necessity &#8211; I can&#8217;t be spending a large monthly amount in the hopes it&#8217;ll land me clients/a job that can justify the costs. Maybe someday, but not now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img data-dominant-color="908a89" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3agz7a97qwa-1024x683.jpg" alt="person holding brown leather bifold wallet" class="not-transparent wp-image-240" style="--dominant-color: #908a89; width:675px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3agz7a97qwa-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3agz7a97qwa-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3agz7a97qwa-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3agz7a97qwa-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3agz7a97qwa.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I&#8217;ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a website today!</figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s also just a personal philosophy you&#8217;ll see pop up a lot when I talk about technology: Why pay someone to do something you could do yourself?  It&#8217;s not a philosophy that extends everywhere in my life (i.e. mowing the lawn, I&#8217;ll happily pay someone else) but I&#8217;m very much a &#8220;build it don&#8217;t buy it&#8221; person when it comes to most learning technology solutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Custom Domain</h3>



<p>This is the one cost I&#8217;m set on, ~$10 a year for your own domain name is a no-brainer as far as I&#8217;m concerned.  I&#8217;m not completely opposed to &#8220;charles.professionalsoundinghost.com&#8221; but &#8220;funfreeblogs4u.xyz/users/charles99523&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to cut it.  It&#8217;s like your email: Gmail is pretty acceptable these days, but doesn&#8217;t a custom address look even better?  And you have to admit to raising an eyebrow when someone gives you a Hotmail right?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Easy to Maintain</h3>



<p>Obviously this one is relative. My idea of easy is probably very different than yours, but even I have my limits. I&#8217;ll cover this in more detail in the future articles in this series, but I started out this journey looking at various static site builders that gave an incredible amount of flexibility, but at too steep a learning curve for what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish. I had to reset myself a few times after wasting days going down bunny trails that just led to more questions than answers. In the end the solution has to balance all the stuff I want to do with the reality of how much time I have to actually do it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img data-dominant-color="e2e1de" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="737" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rakhimdotorg-Blogs-Vs-Blogging-Comic-1024x737.jpg" alt="Graph depicting the relationship between the number of blog posts and the number of posts about elaborate blog setups, with various blogger archetypes labeled on a curve." class="not-transparent wp-image-241" style="--dominant-color: #e2e1de; width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rakhimdotorg-Blogs-Vs-Blogging-Comic-1024x737.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rakhimdotorg-Blogs-Vs-Blogging-Comic-1536x1105.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rakhimdotorg-Blogs-Vs-Blogging-Comic-300x216.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rakhimdotorg-Blogs-Vs-Blogging-Comic-768x553.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rakhimdotorg-Blogs-Vs-Blogging-Comic.jpg 1994w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Very true!  <a href="https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/" class="ek-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Source</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ll outline the solution I ended up with (where I&#8217;m actually writing this postmortem so to speak) in a future article, but I&#8217;m happy with the balance I struck.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accessible, Secure, and Findable</h3>



<p>Early on in this process I hit a wall when I realized one of my tests was being blocked by my current employers firewall! This is obviously a big deal, if one company blocks it then others likely would too, which would really put a damper on that whole &#8220;getting hired&#8221; thing if they can&#8217;t even see what I&#8217;m selling (you know, me). After doing some digging, this can be caused by a lot of factors. The host, the age of the site, the <abbr title="Top Level Domain, the .com or .net etc at the end of a website's address.">TLD,</abbr> not having <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer - Encryption that keeps you safe on any given website. The &quot;S&quot; in &quot;https&quot; that puts the little lock in your address bar.">SSL</abbr>, having too much placeholder content, and a lot more. As a result some of the decisions we&#8217;ll make along the way will be made for us to avoid these issues.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group ticss-67839866 has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="12289739" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="2.425" data-width="320px" width="320px" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/highly-suspect-ratatouille-gif-12289739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Highly Suspect GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/highly-gifs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Highly GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>
</div>



<p>I also want people to find my site eventually.  In the beginning I imagine it&#8217;ll just be former coworkers that I&#8217;ve shared it with, but again the whole &#8220;get hired&#8221; thing kinda requires lots of other people to see it too!  I&#8217;m not interested in become some sort of influencer with a bunch of clickbait crap, but I do need to consider <em>some</em> <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization - Techniques to boost how much a site appear on Google etc.">SEO</abbr> as much as I hate it (maybe a future article, but personally I think SEO has ruined the internet).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Requirements</h2>



<p>I keep referring to this whole thing as &#8220;the site&#8221;, but it&#8217;s really about several components that get duct taped together to make the experience I&#8217;m after.  Let&#8217;s collect all the considerations above into a list of requirements.  I require:</p>



<ul>
<li>A hosting location for a variety of content formats including:
<ul>
<li>Documents &amp; images</li>



<li>Videos</li>



<li>Interactive web &#8220;packages&#8221; including HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>A flexible site authoring platform that can generate both blog-style content and other pages in a visually pleasing way
<ul>
<li>It must be easy to maintain</li>



<li>It must be flexible to support experimentation and demonstration of things I haven&#8217;t thought of yet</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>A custom domain that is professional and not likely to be flagged by firewalls</li>



<li>Relatively easy setup and maintenance on all of the above</li>



<li>Security and SEO on all the above</li>



<li>Low to no cost on any of the above</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Closing</h2>



<p>Am I overthinking all this?  Probably.  But hey, I like thinking!  This whole project is actually a lot of fun for me, and I hope you enjoy the journey!  Next up I&#8217;ll dig into each of the big choices to make on hosting providers and content management, then bring it all together into the solution I chose as well as some alternatives to consider.  See you then!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome!  I&#8217;m Charles Palmer and this is my blog/portfolio/resume, or &#8220;blogfoliosume&#8221;.  I am an adult education (<abbr title="the art or science of teaching adults - Merriam Webster"><a aria-label="andragogy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://elearningindustry.com/the-adult-learning-theory-andragogy-of-malcolm-knowles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">andragogy</a></abbr>) professional with over 15 years experience in Learning and Development.  My specialty is learning technology, specifically finding new ways to integrate emerging technologies into learning experiences.  Over the past 15 years I have established myself as an expert and thought leader, but only inside the company I work for; this site seeks to change that.  Here I will share my experiences, ideas, tips, and more with the hope that the larger <abbr title="The afformentioned Learning and Development">L&amp;D</abbr> community can benefit.  I have benefited from many other experts, so it&#8217;s time to reciprocate!</p>



<p>This site also acts as my portfolio and resume.  I have neglected the world outside my current employer for too long, and that has come back to bite me.  Out here in the big world I don&#8217;t have the advantage of just saying &#8220;remember that project we worked on?&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t have name recognition or an existing catalog of work to point at when seeking jobs.  It&#8217;s going to take some time to scrub all my existing internal work of confidential info, but in the end I intend to rectify the above and establish solid proof of that expertise I claim.  Until that is done I invite you to <a aria-label="check out my LinkedIn profile (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-l-palmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">check out my LinkedIn profile</a> where my work history and skills are documented.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got a long list of articles already started on topics like using generative AI tools, accessibility for neurodivergent audiences, using animation in e-learning, and much more. To start I&#8217;ll be writing some posts about the process of creating this site; I know many in the industry are in need of similar portfolio sites and I hope to help. Stay tuned!</p>



<p>I truly believe I have something valuable to share; so whether you&#8217;re here as a potential employer, or as a fellow L&amp;D professional, thanks for reading and I hope you&#8217;ll check back often!</p>
